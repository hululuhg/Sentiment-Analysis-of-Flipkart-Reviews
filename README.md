This project performs sentiment analysis on Flipkart product reviews using a Bidirectional LSTM model built with TensorFlow/Keras.
The app classifies customer reviews as Positive, Negative and Neutral, and is deployed via Streamlit for an interactive UI.

 Features->
* Sentiment prediction of Flipkart product reviews
* Confidence score for each prediction
* Clean and simple Streamlit user interface
* Deep learning model with **Bidirectional LSTM**
* Custom tokenizer and label encoder used for preprocessing

 Model Architecture->
* Embedding Layer
* **Bidirectional LSTM** Layer
* Dense Layer with ReLU
* Output Layer with Softmax
Trained on preprocessed Flipkart review dataset with binary sentiment labels.

How to Run->
1. Clone the repo:
2. Install dependencies:
3. Run the Streamlit app:

Sample Output->
> Input: *“The product is amazing, very useful and fast delivery.”*
> Prediction: Positive
> Confidence: 96.3%

 Requirements->
* Python 3.7+
* TensorFlow / Keras
* Numpy / Pandas
* scikit-learn
* Streamlit
* Pickle
